Data received from above. When data is received from above, the SR sender
checks the next available sequence number for the packet. If the sequence
number is within the sender’s window, the data is packetized and sent; other-
wise it is either buffered or returned to the upper layer for later transmission,
as in GBN.
2. Timeout. Timers are again used to protect against lost packets. However, each
packet must now have its own logical timer, since only a single packet will
be transmitted on timeout. A single hardware timer can be used to mimic the
operation of multiple logical timers [Varghese 1997].
3. ACK received. If an ACK is received, the SR sender marks that packet as
having been received, provided it is in the window. If the packet’s sequence
number is equal to send_base, the window base is moved forward to the
unacknowledged packet with the smallest sequence number. If the window
moves and there are untransmitted packets with sequence numbers that now
fall within the window, these packets are transmitted.
