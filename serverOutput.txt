Data received from above. When data is received from above, the SR senderchecks the next available sequence number for the packet. If the sequencenumber is within the sender’s window, the data is packetized and sent; other-wise it is either buffered or returned to the upper layer for later transmission,as in GBN.2. Timeout. Timers are again used to protect against lost packets. However, eachpacket must now have its own logical timer, since only a single packet willbe transmitted on timeout. A single hardware timer can be used to mimic theoperation of multiple logical timers [Varghese 1997].3. ACK received. If an ACK is received, the SR sender marks that packet ashaving been received, provided it is in the window. If the packet’s sequencenumber is equal to send_base, the window base is moved forward to theunacknowledged packet with the smallest sequence number. If the windowmoves and there are untransmitted packets with sequence numbers that nowfall within the window, these packets are transmitted.
