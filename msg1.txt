Packet with sequence number in [rcv_base, rcv_base+N-1]is cor-

rectly received. In this case, the received packet falls within the receiverâ€™s win-
dow and a selective ACK packet is returned to the sender. If the packet was not

previously received, it is buffered. If this packet has a sequence number equal to
the base of the receive window (rcv_base in Figure 3.22), then this packet,
and any previously buffered and consecutively numbered (beginning with

rcv_base) packets are delivered to the upper layer. The receive window is

then moved forward by the number of packets delivered to the upper layer. As

an example, consider Figure 3.26. When a packet with a sequence number of

rcv_base=2 is received, it and packets 3, 4, and 5 can be delivered to the
upper layer.
2. Packet with sequence number in [rcv_base-N, rcv_base-1]is cor-
rectly received. In this case, an ACK must be generated, even though this is a
packet that the receiver has previously acknowledged.
3. Otherwise. Ignore the packet
